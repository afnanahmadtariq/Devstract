# The Hidden Costs of Managing a Top-Tier GPT

Launching is cheap. Running is expensive.
Many businesses budget for development but forget **Day 2 Operations**.

## 1. Token Usage (The Obvious Cost)

GPT-4o is efficient, but chatty users add up.

- Input Tokens: Context stuffing (uploading 50 documents) costs money _every single message_ if not managed well.
- **Fix**: Efficient RAG systems that only fetch relevant snippets.

## 2. Vector Storage & Retrieval

Tools like Pinecone or Weaviate charge for storage and read/write operations. If your bot constantly searches the database, that bill grows.

## 3. Monitoring & Alerting

How do you know if your bot is broken? You need 3rd party monitoring tools (like LangSmith or Helicone) to track latency and errors. These are SaaS subscriptions.

## 4. Maintenance (Data Drift)

Your company data changes. Pricing updates, new policies.

- **The Cost**: Engineering time to build sync pipelines that keep the bot updated.
- If you don't pay this, you pay in **Reputational Damage** (bot giving old prices).

## 5. Liability Insurance

Yes, enterprise AI insurance is becoming real. If your bot gives bad financial advice, are you covered?

## Conclusion

Treat your GPT like a Product, not a Project. Products have operating biases (Opex). Plan for them to ensure your ROI remains positive.

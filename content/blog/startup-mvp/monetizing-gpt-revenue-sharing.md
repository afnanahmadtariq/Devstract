# Monetizing Your Expertise: Revenue Sharing in the GPT Store

You have the expertise. OpenAI has the traffic.
The Revenue Sharing model (updated in October 2025) has stabilized. It's no longer a black box.

## How You Identify Opportunity

Revenue is based on **Engagement** (specifically, retention and complexity of interaction), not just clicks.
A bot that says "Hello" 1,000 times earns nothing.
A bot that helps a user write a novel for 3 hours earns significantly.

## Strategies for Earnings

### 1. Proprietary Data

Do you have 10,000 verified legal templates? Or a database of rare car parts?
Wrap that data in a GPT. Users can't get it from the base model. That's your moat.

### 2. Complex Utilities

Build a tool. "Convert text to SQL code." "Format citations for APA style."
Tools that save professional time are "sticky." Users come back daily.

### 3. The "Freemium" Funnel

Use the GPT Store for discovery, but monetize the backend.
_"For the basic report, just ask me. For the detailed PDF, click here to sign up for our Pro Dashboard."_

## The Consultant's Advantage

If you are a consultant, the GPT is your lead magnet that pays _you_. It serves as a low-cost entry point for clients who eventually upgrade to your high-ticket human services.

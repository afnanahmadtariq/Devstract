# Progressive Web Apps vs Native Apps: A Business Owner's Guide

You want a mobile presence. But development is expensive. Do you spend $50k on a native iOS/Android app, or go with a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a fraction of the cost?

This guide breaks down the pros and cons of each to help you decide.

## What is a Native App?

A native app is built specifically for a mobile operating system (iOS or Android) using languages like Swift or Kotlin (or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter). You download it from the App Store or Play Store.

**Pros:**

- **Performance**: Nothing beats native speed and smoothness.
- **Hardware Access**: Full access to camera, Bluetooth, GPS, contacts, etc.
- **Engagement**: Push notifications work reliably on all devices.
- **Prestige**: Being on the App Store adds credibility.

**Cons:**

- **Cost**: You often need two codebases (or a complex cross-platform one).
- **Friction**: Users have to download and install it.
- **Updates**: You have to wait for App Store approval to push updates.

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App is a website that behaves like an app. You can access it via a URL, but you can also "install" it to your home screen. It works offline and loads instantly.

**Pros:**

- **Cost**: One codebase runs everywhere (web, iOS, Android).
- **No Install Friction**: Users just visit a link. No "Download" required.
- **Instant Updates**: Push code to your server, and everyone has the new version instantly.
- **SEO**: Its content can be indexed by Google.

**Cons:**

- **Limited Hardware Access**: Can't access Bluetooth or advanced sensors as easily.
- **iOS Limitations**: Apple restricts some PWA features (like push notifications) compared to Android.
- **Performance**: Slightly slower than native for heavy graphics/gaming.

## The Decision Matrix

**Choose Native App if:**

- You need high-performance graphics (e.g., a game).
- You rely heavily on device hardware (e.g., AR, Bluetooth integration).
- Push notifications on iOS are critical to your business model.

**Choose PWA if:**

- You are an e-commerce store, news site, or B2B SaaS.
- You have a limited budget and need to launch fast.
- You want your app to be discoverable via Google Search.

## The Hybrid Future

Many companies start with a PWA to validate their idea and build a user base, then launch a native app later for their power users.

At **Devstract**, we specialize in both. We can build a high-performance PWA today that can be wrapped into a native app tomorrow. (Related: [Retail Store Mobile App Guide](/blog/mobile-apps/mobile-app-retail-2026) and [From Idea to SaaS MVP](/blog/startup-mvp/saas-mvp-guide))

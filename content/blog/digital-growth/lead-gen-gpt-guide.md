# How to Build a Lead Generation GPT (That Actually Works)

The "PDF Ebook" lead magnet is dying. Conversion rates are dropping because users don't want to read 20 pages; they want to _solve a problem_.

Enter the **Auditing GPT**.

## The Concept

Instead of "Download our SEO Guide," offer "Talk to our SEO Auditor Bot."
The user pastes their URL. The GPT analyzes it and gives advice.
**The Catch:** To get the full detailed report, or to schedule a fix, the GPT asks for their email.

## How to Capture the Lead (Technical)

You cannot just ask for an email and hope. You need an **Action**.

1.  **User**: "My site speed is slow."
2.  **GPT**: "I see large images. I can generate a full optimization plan for you. Where should I send it?"
3.  **User**: "marketing@company.com"
4.  **GPT (Action)**: Calls `zapier_webhook` -> Sends email to Hubspot -> Triggers "Welcome Sequence."

## The "Value First" Rule

Most failed Lead Gen GPTs ask for email too early.
**Rule:** Give 3 "Ah-ha!" moments for free.

- "Your H1 tag is missing." (Value 1)
- "Your images are 4MB." (Value 2)
- "Your meta description is blank." (Value 3)
- "I found 10 more critical errors. Send me your email to get the full list." (The Ask)

## Why This Converts at 20%+

It engages the principle of **Reciprocity**. You have already proven your value (the AI's advice). The user trusts that the "Full Report" will be equally valuable.

Stop building static forms. Build interactive consultants.

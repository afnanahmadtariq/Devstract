# Top 7 Use Cases for Internal Company GPTs

While the "Merchants" update grabs headlines, the quiet revolution is happening _inside_ companies. Privacy-first, internal-only GPTs are saving teams thousands of hours. Here are the 7 most high-ROI implementations we have built for clients this month.

## 1. The "Onboarding Buddy" (HR)

New hires ask the same 50 questions daily. "What is the Wifi password?" "How do I expense lunch?" "Where is the holiday policy?"
An Onboarding GPT trained on your Employee Handbook answers these instantly, freeing up HR to focus on culture.

## 2. The "Legacy Code Explainer" (Engineering)

For startups with 5-year-old codebases: feed your repo documentation into a GPT. Junior devs can ask, "How does the authentication middleware work?" and get a detailed breakdown with code snippets.

## 3. The "Proposal Writer" (Sales)

Upload your last 50 winning proposals. The Sales GPT can then draft a new SOW (Statement of Work) based on a few bullet points, matching your company's tone and pricing structure perfectly.

## 4. The "Customer Voice" Analyst (Product)

Connect a GPT to your Zendesk or Intercom export. Ask it: "What are the top 3 feature requests this week?" or "Summarize the sentiment around our latest release." It turns noise into signal.

## 5. The "Compliance Offer" (Legal)

For fintech/health companies, a GPT that knows every regulation (GDPR, HIPAA) can review marketing copy and flag potential risks before it even reaches the legal team.

## 6. The "SQL Wizard" (Data)

Non-technical managers shouldn't need to bug data science for every number. A GPT connected to your read-only database replica allows them to ask plain English questions ("Show me Q3 churn rate") and get the data.

## 7. The "Meeting Synthesizer" (Ops)

Upload transcripts from Zoom/Teams. The GPT extracts action items, assigns owners, and updates the Jira board (via Actions) automatically.

**Which department helps your business the most?** Any of these can be built in under 2 weeks with the right partner.

# Case Study: Increasing Conversion Rates by 40% with AI-Driven Checkout

**Client**: _UrbanKicks_ (Anonymized), a mid-sized sneaker retailer.
**Challenge**: High traffic, low mobile conversion rate (1.2%). Users abandoned carts due to clunky forms and page load speeds.

## The Solution: "Chat-to-Buy"

Instead of optimizing the old mobile site, Devstract helped UrbanKicks be one of the pilot partners for **ChatGPT Merchants**.

We built a custom integration that allowed users to:

1.  Upload a photo of a shoe they liked.
2.  Have the AI identify the style.
3.  Check UrbanKicks' inventory for matches.
4.  **Buy it with one tap** using OpenAI's stored payment credentials.

## The Implementation

- **Timeline**: 3 Weeks.
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js middleware, Shopify Admin API, OpenAI Merchants SDK.
- **Visual Search**: We implemented a Vector Database (Pinecone) to index UrbanKicks' catalog visually, allowing the AI to match "vibe" and "style" not just text.

## The Results (After 30 Days)

The results were staggering compared to their traditional mobile web channel:

- **Conversion Rate**: 1.2% -> **1.7%** (Standard Web) vs **4.8%** (AI Channel).
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Increased by 15% due to AI cross-selling ("These socks match that colorway perfectly").
- **Support Tickets**: Dropped by 30% as the AI answered size/fit questions pre-purchase.

## Why It Worked

Friction kills sales. The AI channel removed the friction of navigation, filtering, and form-filling. It turned shopping into a conversation between a knowledgeable clerk and a buyer.

**Your business is leaking revenue at the checkout page.** Let's fix it with AI.

# The Future of the GPT Store (2026 Prediction)

If 2024 was the year of the Chatbot, and 2025 was the year of the Agent, what is 2026?

Based on the trajectory of OpenAI's updates (including the October Merchants integration), here is our roadmap for the next 12 months.

## 1. The Death of the "Interface"

Currently, you "visit" a GPT.
In 2026, the GPT visits you.
The OS-level integration (already started with Apple Intelligence) will mean the GPT Store isn't a website; it's a library of skills your phone has.
**Prediction**: "Siri, use the 'Devstract Legal Bot' to review this contract in my email."

## 2. Multi-Agent Ecosystems

Right now, one GPT does one thing.
In 2026, GPTs will talk to each other.
Your "Travel Agent GPT" will negotiate with the "Airline's Booking GPT" without you ever seeing the chat. They will just present the final ticket.
**Business Impact**: You need to build APIs that _other bots_ can consume, not just humans.

## 3. Video-First Interaction

With the rise of Sora and video-input models, Shopping GPTs will let you hold a pair of shoes up to the camera and ask, "Are these fake?"
The visual barrier will vanish.

## Conclusion

The companies building static websites today are building Blockbusters in a Netflix world. The future is fluid, agentic, and invisible.

## Blog Post Structure

1. **Compelling Headline**: Clear, benefit-focused, and intriguing
2. **Introduction**: Hook the reader and outline the value proposition
3. **Main Content**: Well-organized with subheadings, bullet points, and visuals
4. **Conclusion**: Summarize key points and include a call-to-action
5. **Meta Information**: SEO-optimized title, meta description, and tags

## SEO & Indexing Best Practices (Avoiding "GSC Ghosting")

Google (2025/2026) is aggressive about deprioritizing content that lacks "Information Gain" or authority. To ensure your posts get indexed:

### 1. Avoid "AI-Only" Patterns

- **The "2-Paragraph Rule"**: Never start a post with a generic AI summary. The first 2 paragraphs MUST contain a unique opinion, a specific real-world example, or a direct answer to the user's problem.
- **Information Gain**: Every post must add something new to the conversation—new data, a counter-intuitive take, or a personal experience. If it's a rehash of the top 3 search results, it likely won't index.

### 2. Internal Linking (The "Anti-Orphan" Strategy)

- **No Orphans**: Every new blog post must have at least **3 internal links** pointing TO it from other existing pages (e.g., from the homepage, related articles, or category pages).
- **Contextual Links**: Link naturally within the body text, difficult keywords are preferred over "click here".

### 3. The "Mega-Post" Strategy

- **Consolidate vs. Dilute**: Instead of 5 short posts (500 words) on similar variations of a topic, create one **Mega-Post** (1,500+ words) that covers the topic comprehensively. Google prefers one authoritative page over five thin ones.

## SEO Considerations

- **Keyword Research**: Target specific queries but write for humans first.
- **Title Tags**: Keep under 60 characters, front-load the main keyword.
- **Meta Descriptions**: ~155 characters, include a call-to-action or value prop.
- **URL Structure**: Short, descriptive URLs (e.g., `devstract.site/blog/fix-gsc-ghosting` instead of `/blog/how-to-fix-google-search-console-indexing-issues-2026`).
- **Images**: Use unique images (or heavily customized stock) with descriptive Alt Text.
- **Schema Markup**: Ensure Article or BlogPosting schema is present.

## Content Calendar Suggestions

- Post 2-3 times per week

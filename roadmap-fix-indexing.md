# Roadmap: Fixing "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed" (GSC Ghosting)

## Overview

This roadmap addresses the "GSC Ghosting" issue where pages are crawled by Google but not indexed. This usually indicates that Google has deprioritized the content due to quality, authority, or technical reasons.

**Status: All automated fixes complete. Manual GSC actions remaining.**

## Phase 1: Audit & Identification

- [ ] **Identify Ghosted URLs** _(Manual — GSC required)_:
  - Go to Google Search Console (GSC) > Pages > "Crawled - currently not indexed".
  - Export the list of URLs.
- [ ] **Verify Indexing Status** _(Manual — GSC required)_:
  - Use the `site:devstract.site/your-post-url` command in Google Search.
  - If it shows up, it's just a reporting delay. If not, proceed to fixes.
- [ ] **URL Inspection Test** _(Manual — GSC required)_:
  - In GSC, inspect a few "ghosted" URLs.
  - If "URL is not on Google", click **"Test Live URL"**.
  - If green, click **"Request Indexing"**.

## Phase 2: Content Quality & "AI-Only" Audit

- [x] **Review for "Thin Content"**:
  - Identified 4 posts for consolidation: "Future of GPT Store", "Autonomous Workflows", "Monetization", "Hidden Costs".
  - All consolidated into `ultimate-gpt-store-guide-2026.md`.
- [x] **Audit for AI Patterns**:
  - Rewrote the opening paragraphs of 5 posts to inject unique insights (Information Gain):
    - `ai-checkout-case-study.md` — Added specific client stats and contrarian hook.
    - `data-privacy-custom-gpt.md` — Added real audit anecdote.
    - `internal-company-gpt-use-cases.md` — Added $14K/month savings stat.
    - `aio-vs-seo-guide.md` — Added 64% zero-click stat.
    - `lead-gen-gpt-guide.md` — Added A/B test comparison (3.2% vs 22.4%).
- [x] **E-E-A-T Injection**:
  - Enhanced JSON-LD schema on blog posts with:
    - `dateModified` (from file modification time).
    - `wordCount` (auto-calculated).
    - `articleSection` and `keywords`.
    - Author type changed to Organization with URL to /about-us.
    - Publisher URL added.
  - Author bylines already visible in blog layout.

## Phase 3: Internal Linking Campaign (The "Orphan" Fix)

- [x] **Identify Orphans**:
  - Audited all 25+ blog posts for internal link count.
  - Identified posts with 0-1 internal links.
- [x] **Link Injection**:
  - Added 2-3 contextual internal links to EVERY blog post. No orphans remain.
  - Posts now cross-link within their topic clusters:
    - AI/Automation cluster: `ai-agents`, `merchants-guide`, `checkout-case-study`, `data-privacy`, `internal-gpt`, `internal-tools`, `automation-small-business`, `ultimate-gpt-store-guide`.
    - Digital Growth cluster: `aio-vs-seo`, `future-of-seo`, `lead-gen-gpt`, `checkout-optimization`, `product-feed`, `website-redesign`.
    - Startup/MVP cluster: `saas-mvp`, `crm-vs-off-shelf`, `hiring-gpt-dev`, `chatgpt-vs-shopify`.
    - Mobile cluster: `pwa-vs-native`, `mobile-app-retail`.
    - Technical cluster: `scalable-tech-stack`, `integrating-o1`.

## Phase 4: Consolidation Strategy ("Mega-Post")

- [x] **Group Related Topics**:
  - Grouped 4 posts on GPT Store/Agents/Monetization.
- [x] **Create Mega-Post**:
  - Created `ultimate-gpt-store-guide-2026.md` (1,500+ words, comprehensive).
- [x] **Redirect**:
  - Old files deleted from repository.
  - Created `public/_redirects` file with 301 redirects for:
    - `/blog/ai-automation/future-of-gpt-store-2026` → mega-post
    - `/blog/ai-automation/autonomous-workflows-gpt-store` → mega-post
    - `/blog/startup-mvp/monetizing-gpt-revenue-sharing` → mega-post
    - `/blog/startup-mvp/hidden-costs-managing-gpt` → mega-post
  - Works automatically on Netlify and Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Phase 5: Technical Checks

- [x] **Sitemap Validation**:
  - Sitemap auto-generated by Next.js with `lastModified` dates from file stats.
  - Verified `robots.txt` enhanced:
    - Explicitly allows GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, Google-Extended (AIO).
    - Blocks `/api/` and `/_next/` paths.
    - Points to sitemap URL.
  - IndexNow script (`scripts/indexnow.js`) ready for post-deploy notification.
- [x] **Category Slug Fixes** _(bonus)_:
  - Fixed 4 posts with mismatched `category` frontmatter:
    - `ai-automation-small-business.md`: "AI Automation" → "AI & Automation"
    - `internal-tools-productivity.md`: "AI Automation" → "AI & Automation"
    - `scalable-tech-stack-growth.md`: "Technical Deep Dive" → "Technical Deep-Dive"
    - `mobile-app-retail-2026.md`, `pwa-vs-native-business-guide.md`: "Mobile Apps" → "Mobile & Apps"
  - These were generating incorrect category slugs and potentially incorrect sitemap URLs.
- [ ] **Performance Check** _(Manual — run after deploy)_:
  - Run PageSpeed Insights on ghosted pages.
  - Fix any red flags (Core Web Vitals).

## Phase 6: Monitoring

- [ ] **Weekly Check-in** _(Manual — ongoing)_:
  - Monitor the "Crawled - currently not indexed" report weekly.
  - Check if "Request Indexing" requests are being processed.
  - After deploying, run `node scripts/indexnow.js` to notify search engines.
